## About WG-26 Connectathons
A recurring topic of discussion during DICOM WG-26 meetings is how to engage the pathology community with DICOM and raise the level of awareness amongst pathologists about both DICOM and interoperability. Since 2017, WG-26 sponsored “Connectathons” have proven to be a useful tool for both helping increase interoperability awareness in the community, validate the capabilities of participants, and identify areas for improvement in the standard.  

The long-term goals of the WG-26 Connectathons are:
- Demonstrate the benefits of DICOM for whole slide imaging to the pathology community
- Engage implementers to further develop DICOM capabilities in their offerings
- Provide a mechanism for experimenting with interoperability improvements
- Identify weaknesses and deficiencies in DICOM for WSI, to improve and  expand the standard
- Enhance the technical scope of the demonstration with each iteration
- Integrating WG-26 with the broader interoperability ecosystem (IHE-PALM, etc.)
